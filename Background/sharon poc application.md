Here are the notes that Richard sent me last week about it.

​​​​​*****************

Here is a revised outline from what you sent. I added Tamika and her role and pivoted the discussion around the NIL Athlete model. 

. Roles & Mandates
Tamika Tremaglio: Market maker and monetizer — shaping relationships with universities, athletes, and leagues. She ensures the NIL product connects to revenue models and adoption pathways.
Richard: Product visionary and owner — aligning the NIL use case with market gaps, ensuring the product direction, and shaping the RAG engine into a defensible compliance and recruiting platform.
Sharon: Product strategist — refining GTM, licensing, and monetization strategy; coordinating with partners and institutions.
Modus: Engineering + product fulfillment backbone — with Jeff, Dr. Jerry, and a dedicated team to finish the NIL POC and scale it.
2. NIL Roadmap
Our plan is staged and clear:
Phase 1: Basketball POCs
Men’s: Auburn (POC), Sacramento State (POC), plus 4 additional top-tier programs.
Women’s: South Carolina (POC) plus 2 additional programs.
Total: 6 Men’s + 3 Women’s programs.
Phase 2: Expansion to Football
Targeted for Q3 next year.
Football represents the largest NIL market and accelerates adoption across athletics departments.
3. Product Differentiation
The NIL Scorecard and AI Analysis platform offer:
Recruiting advantage: Athletes receive individualized NIL scorecards with insights into career arcs and earning potential — something coaches and recruits can’t get anywhere else.
AI matchup analysis: Distinct from traditional scouting reports, providing predictive insights and lineup strategies.
Compliance assurance: Powered by the RAG backbone, ensuring defensibility in NCAA and legal frameworks.
4. Revenue Model (Preliminary)
Basketball POCs (First 9 Schools):
Each program pays for POC licensing + annual platform subscription.
Revenue grows with recruiting advantage → higher demand for adoption.
Football Pivot (Q3):
Football programs command significantly larger budgets and NIL exposure.
Success in basketball de-risks adoption, allowing rapid scaling.
(We will share preliminary revenue calculations for these 9 schools and model football expansion as part of Thursday’s discussion.)
