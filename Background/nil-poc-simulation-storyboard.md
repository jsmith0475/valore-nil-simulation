- **Frame 2.4 – Community Pulse**: Heatmap radiates out to local sponsors, alumni hubs, and fan clusters.
- **Transition**: Data particles stream inward forming an athlete silhouette for the next scene.

## Scene 3 · Athlete NIL Journey
- **Frame 3.1 – Athlete Introduction**: Athlete archetype (e.g., "Playmaker Guard") appears with name, class, social handles.
- **Frame 3.2 – Scorecard Bloom**: Circular dashboard blossoms showing parasocial intensity, identity alignment, authenticity index, network multiplier.
- **Frame 3.3 – Behavioral Insights**: Tooltip windows explain each metric; references (Horton & Wohl, Tajfel & Turner) slide in subtly.
- **Frame 3.4 – Narrative Moments**: Short clips/stills cycle (practice highlight, community service, podcast appearance) to humanize the data.
- **Frame 3.5 – Compliance Snapshot**: RAG panel flags state/NCAA notes, risk level, and audit log excerpt.
- **Transition**: Scorecard elements transform into color-coded beams feeding into the Agent Council.

## Scene 4 · Agent Council Arena
- **Frame 4.1 – Arena Establishing Shot**: Circular chamber with seven seats, each glowing distinct color/ icon representing agents (Social Media, Performance, Market, Brand, Psychology, Compliance, Ethics).
- **Frame 4.2 – Evidence Exchange**: Animated beams carrying data fragments (sentiment, stats, regulations) pass among agents.
- **Frame 4.3 – Negotiation Moments**: Focus on agent pair dialogues, showing rationale snippets and confidence levels.
- **Frame 4.4 – Bias Safeguard**: Compliance/Ethics agents activate shield effect when bias threshold triggers; shows demographic parity check.
- **Frame 4.5 – Consensus Formation**: Beams converge into central valuation orb; final NIL figure appears with explainability layers.
- **Transition**: Valuation orb descends onto a basketball court grid.

## Scene 5 · Matchup Intelligence
- **Frame 5.1 – Court Overlay**: Digital court with lineup placements for target game scenario.
- **Frame 5.2 – Synergy Visualization**: Lines connecting players pulse to show chemistry and positioning advantages.
- **Frame 5.3 – Psychological Momentum**: Crowd sentiment wave animates, influenced by athlete authenticity and fan loyalty metrics.
- **Frame 5.4 – Scenario Toggle**: User switches roster combinations; immediate changes to win probability and NIL uplift projections.
- **Transition**: Court lines morph into revenue trajectories.

## Scene 6 · Revenue Observatory
- **Frame 6.1 – Glass Floor View**: Transparent platform displaying revenue streams flowing into each program node.
- **Frame 6.2 – Licensing & Subscription**: Bars grow for POC licensing fees and annual subscriptions; tooltips explain assumptions.
- **Frame 6.3 – Demand Flywheel**: Animated loop showing how recruiting success boosts adoption and revenue.
- **Frame 6.4 – Football Horizon**: Camera pans to larger orbs representing football programs with higher budget markers.
- **Frame 6.5 – Call to Action**: Overlay invites stakeholders to schedule POC deep dive, linking to next steps.
- **Final Transition**: Scene fades back to VALORE emblem with closing affirmation of mission.

## Interactive Pathways (Optional Enhancements)
- Role-based overlays (Coach, Compliance, Athlete) adjusting copy and data emphasis.
- Time-lapse mode to show data evolution over a season.
- Bookmark/share features for stakeholders to capture specific insights.

## Production Notes
- Maintain consistent ambient audio thread, with scene-specific accents.
- Use color palettes aligned with brand guidelines (to be finalized) while accommodating program colors subtly.
- Ensure every scene has at least one explicit behavioral science callout and one compliance assurance moment.
