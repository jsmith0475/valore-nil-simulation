# VALORE Emulation Alignment Assessment

## 1. Purpose
- Evaluate the current Simulation2 emulation experience against strategic intent captured in `Background/paper.md`, `Background/sharon poc application.md`, and `Background/multi-agentic NIL.md`.
- Highlight where the build already expresses the target behaviors, where coverage is partial, and the critical deltas required for stakeholder confidence in Phase 1 basketball POCs.

## 2. Summary View
- **Strategic Alignment:** The emulation now reflects the seven-agent paradigm, athlete-level behavioral metrics, and the Phase 1 basketball roadmap. We have an experiential layer that communicates VALORE’s differentiators, mirroring the research language and Sharon’s executive framing.
- **Behavioral Depth:** Parasocial, authenticity, fairness, compliance, and market signals are generated synthetically for both programs and athletes. The Agent Signals tab and the new Live Feeds view expose the specialized lenses and raw evidence streams emphasized in the research manuscripts.
- **Primary Gaps:** Calibration and validation remain theoretical; agent negotiations lack persistent evidence trails; compliance automation, licensing story, and cross-sport expansion are absent; and stakeholder-specific workflows (Tamika/Richard/Sharon/Modus) are not yet surfaced.

## 3. Mapping to Background References

### 3.1 Multi-Agent Research Foundations (`Background/paper.md`, `Background/multi-agentic NIL.md`)
- **Seven Specialized Agents:** Implemented via agent metric definitions and Agent Signals tab; each panel reflects the attention heads described (engagement, sentiment, virality, etc.).
- **Behavioral Science Integration:** Parasocial (EI, IF, CR, LI, TC), authenticity (C, VA, BC, CS, TS), social identity, fairness, and compliance computations mirror the formulas in the research manuscript.
- **Emergent Coordination:** WebSocket stream simulates multi-agent negotiation (evidence, consensus, bias alerts) and now delivers athlete-level agent deltas; however, the consensus protocol is still scripted rather than dynamically negotiated.
- **Transparency & Audit:** Scores and deltas are visible, but the paper emphasises long-form reasoning transcripts, replayable debates, and model provenance—these artefacts are not yet captured or exposed.

### 3.2 Sharon POC Application (`Background/sharon poc application.md`)
- **Phase 1 Scope:** Nine basketball programs (6 men’s, 3 women’s) are represented with synthetic profiles and scenarios, matching the stated POC plan.
- **Roles & Mandates:** No explicit workspaces or dashboards exist for Tamika (market maker), Richard (product owner), Sharon (strategist), or Modus (delivery), despite their defined mandates.
- **Commercial Story:** Revenue model, subscription tiers, and football pivot narrative are absent. Compliance-as-a-service story (RAG-backed defensibility) is referenced in the outline yet not visualised.

### 3.3 Paper & Multi-Agentic NIL Overlaps
- **Theory-to-Product Traceability:** Synthetic overview explains score composition while the Agent Signals and Live Feeds tabs contextualise agents and raw evidence, providing the explainability demanded in the papers. Linking these explanations directly to citations or model cards would further strengthen traceability.
- **Fairness & Ethics:** Fairness index, compliance risk, and ethics agent metrics are displayed, but the remediation loop (bias mitigation actions, ethics watchdog alerts) described in the research is still conceptual.

## 4. Current Emulation Coverage
- **Program Layer:** Behavioral snapshots with raw signals, PSR/authenticity components, fairness, compliance, valuation, and scenario highlights.
- **Athlete Layer:** Rolling sentiment/interactions series, valuation deltas, and specialized agent metrics powering the Agent Signals tab and WebSocket updates.
- **Live Experience:** Emulation loop pushes updates every ~4–7 s, the Agent Stream shows program + athlete deltas, and the Agent Signals tab ranks athletes per agent focus area.

## 5. Identified Gaps & Recommendations

| Area | Gap vs Background Docs | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Provenance & Replay | Research emphasises transparent coordination and evidentiary trails; current emulation does not store agent dialogue, rationale, or prompt/state snapshots. | Capture agent event logs (JSON + natural language) per session; surface a “Replay” timeline in the Agent Signals tab with download/export for audit teams. |
| Compliance Backbone | Sharon outline highlights RAG-powered compliance defensibility; UI only exposes risk percentages. | Build a Compliance Ops module showing policy citations, disclosure status, remediation tasks, and NCAA/state audit readiness aligned with RACA-006 outputs. |
| Commercial Narrative | Sharon memo expects financial modeling and football expansion go/no-go storylines; app is silent on monetization. | Add Business Outlook view with POC licensing assumptions, revenue projections, and football readiness KPI toggle; connect to persona dashboards (Tamika/Richard). |
| Calibration & Real Data Plan | Papers cite validation frameworks; synthetic heuristics remain uncalibrated. | Define coefficient overrides, plan integration with historical NIL deals, and create a “calibration mode” comparing synthetic vs. reference datasets. |
| Persona Workflows | Defined roles have unique decision needs; experience is persona-neutral. | Introduce persona presets that reshape dashboards (e.g., Tamika → market/commercial metrics, Sharon → GTM/license tracker, Richard → roadmap/test coverage). |
| Ethics Remediation | Research expects continuous fairness optimization, not passive reporting. | Implement ethics playbooks that trigger actionable recommendations, escalation states, and confirmation logs when parity thresholds are crossed. |
| Agent Negotiation Dynamics | Papers describe goal-oriented consensus; current sequence is scripted and deterministic. | Explore stochastic or rule-based negotiation variations, conflict resolution, and agent override scenarios to mirror emergent intelligence claims. |
| Live Data Sources | Background docs reference ingestion of real social/market feeds; emulation is closed-world synthetic. | Document data onboarding roadmap (APIs, ETL, consent flows) and stub connectors to demonstrate readiness. |
| Football & Other Sports | Roadmap emphasises football pivot; application is basketball-only. | Reserve architecture hooks for sport-specific models (e.g., roster size, schedule volatility) and add read-only preview cards to signal future coverage. |
| Narrative Generation Depth | Agent interplay should inform narratives; current GPT calls lack explicit agent evidence references. | Feed agent metrics/deltas into narrative prompts and display source attributions alongside generated copy to match research transparency goals. |

## 6. Priority Actions (Next Iteration)
1. **Observability:** Persist multi-agent conversations, valuation rationales, and store/stream for replay. Provide export for audit/compliance partners.
2. **Compliance Module:** Deliver RAG-backed compliance center with citation graphs, disclosure tracking, and remediation workflow driven by RACA metrics.
3. **Stakeholder Dashboards:** Launch persona presets/dashboards tailored to Tamika, Richard, Sharon, and Modus with context-specific KPIs and calls to action.
4. **Business Narrative:** Add commercial outlook (pricing scenarios, ROI estimates, football pivot readiness) to align with executive-facing messaging.
5. **Calibration & Data Roadmap:** Publish calibration plan, coefficient overrides, and dataset onboarding strategy (real NIL deals, social sentiment feeds).
6. **Ethics Automation:** Implement mitigation playbooks triggered by EOA alerts, including confirmation logging and parity uplift recommendations.
7. **Negotiation Realism:** Experiment with dynamic agent negotiation flows (varying viewpoints, conflicts) to support emergent intelligence claims.

## 7. Conclusion
The Simulation2 emulation has advanced significantly, aligning with core research principles and Phase 1 basketball objectives. The addition of agent-specific athlete metrics and the Agent Signals dashboard marks a major step toward the envisioned multi-agent behavioral intelligence platform. Remaining work should focus on auditability, compliance execution, commercial storytelling, and stakeholder-specific workflows to fully realize the intent articulated across the background documents.
