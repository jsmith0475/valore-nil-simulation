# NIL Behavioral Theory Blueprint

The VALORE NIL simulation translates research from psychology, sociology, and behavioral economics into measurable components. It anchors to the Phase 1 basketball POC focus (Auburn, Sacramento State, Houston, Gonzaga, Kansas, Villanova men; South Carolina, Stanford, Louisville women) and synthesizes the following pillars.

## 1. Parasocial Relationship Model

- **Emotional Intensity (EI)** — Derived from sentiment mean/volatility in fan discourse and highlight resonance; stresses authentic highs rather than viral spikes.
- **Interaction Frequency (IF)** — Captures sustained conversation volume; ratios between weekly interaction velocity and baseline highlight durable fandom.
- **Community Resonance (CR)** — Tracks share rates and content alignment to see if messaging carries brand storylines into everyday talk.
- **Loyalty Index (LI)** — Reflects retention vs. churn in supporter cohorts; proxies whether collectives can rely on repeat participation.
- **Trust & Continuity (TC)** — Incorporates schedule stability, burn-out risk, and narrative consistency.

Weighted aggregation of these components yields the Parasocial Strength Score shown in the dashboard. Bias monitoring checks demographic parity when projecting parasocial uplift into valuations.

## 2. Authenticity & Identity Signaling

- **Consistency (C)** — Measures whether content cadence and tone align with declared athlete values.
- **Value Alignment (VA)** — Combines retention and sentiment to determine if stories resonate with alumni, donors, and local partners.
- **Behavioral Credibility (BC)** — Surfaces stability in behavior; penalizes sharp churn shocks or conflict signals.
- **Community Stewardship (CS)** — Follows community/booster engagements (AMAs, clinics) to gauge positive spillover.
- **Team Synchrony (TS)** — Uses lineup and locker-room indicators to ensure NIL arcs reinforce on-court strategy.

These dimensions reduce the risk of over-rotating on raw exposure and provide ethics/compliance agents with evidence to justify campaigns.

## 3. Fairness, Compliance, and Ethical Guardrails

- **Fairness Index** — Applies demographic parity and opportunity spread metrics across the nine Phase 1 programs.
- **Compliance Risk** — Tracks disclosure cadence, audit risk, and alignment with conference/state regulations.
- **Bias Alerts** — Fire when fairness drifts below thresholds; the Ethics agent injects mitigation prompts into negotiation streams.

## 4. Market & Economic Context

Market Intelligence incorporates comparable deal databases, regional sponsor appetite, macro-economic cues, and timing for peak activation windows. The Brand Alignment agent uses psychological profiling to pair athlete archetypes with partner narratives, ensuring valuations reflect both supply-side (athlete) and demand-side (brand) readiness.

## 5. Agent Cohort Overview

| Agent | Domain Focus | Key Outputs |

| Market Intelligence | Comparable deals, sponsor demand | Comparable Deal Alignment, Market Timing |
| Brand Alignment | Narrative fit, activation readiness | Values Match, Story Resonance |
| Psychological Profile | Fan identity, influence mechanics | Fan Identity Tie, Trust Velocity |
| Risk & Compliance | Regulatory posture, disclosure health | Regulatory Score, Audit Risk |
| Ethics Oversight | Bias detection, fairness drift | Ethics Confidence, Bias Index |
