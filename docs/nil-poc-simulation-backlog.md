# VALORE NIL Simulation – Development Backlog v0.1

## Sprint 0 – Alignment & Foundations
- **S0-01 Stakeholder Kickoff**: Review approach, storyboard, and data schema with leadership (Tamika, Richard, Sharon, Modus) for sign-off.
- **S0-02 Brand & Accessibility Guidelines**: Collect or create visual standards, color palettes, typography, audio direction, and accessibility requirements.
- **S0-03 Asset Inventory Plan**: Define media needs (video, imagery, audio) and assign production/collection responsibilities.

## Sprint 1 – Narrative & Experience Blueprint
- **S1-01 Storyboard Refinement**: Incorporate feedback; lock scene scripts, transitions, and key animations.
- **S1-02 Copy Drafting**: Produce long-form and microcopy for each scene, including theory citations and compliance messaging.
- **S1-03 Data Prototyping**: Populate sample JSON entries for one men’s and one women’s program to validate structure.
- **S1-04 UX Wireframes**: Build low-fidelity wireframes for desktop and mobile breakpoints covering all scenes.
- **S1-05 Audio Mood Board**: Curate ambient soundtrack concepts and sound cues for scene transitions.

## Sprint 2 – Visual & Interaction Design
- **S2-01 High-Fidelity Comps**: Develop visual designs for scenes, ensuring behavioral science elements are prominent.
- **S2-02 Motion Spec**: Document animation timing, easing, and responsive behavior for key interactions.
- **S2-03 Iconography & Agent Visuals**: Create distinct visuals for each agent and behavioral metric.
- **S2-04 Accessibility Review**: Validate designs against WCAG (color contrast, text size, keyboard flow).

## Sprint 3 – Front-End Scaffold
- **S3-01 Repository Setup**: Initialize Git project structure with directories (`public/`, `data/`, `assets/`, `styles/`, `scripts/`).
- **S3-02 Base Layout Implementation**: Construct semantic HTML sections aligned with storyboard scenes.
- **S3-03 Data Binding Layer**: Implement JS loaders to ingest JSON data for programs, athletes, agents.
- **S3-04 Animation Framework Integration**: Select and configure animation libraries (CSS transitions, GSAP, or lightweight alternative).
- **S3-05 Accessibility Baseline**: Ensure tab order, ARIA landmarks, and alt text scaffolding.

## Sprint 4 – Feature Buildout
- **S4-01 Leadership Prelude Module**
- **S4-02 Program Constellation Visualization**
- **S4-03 Athlete NIL Journey Scorecards**
- **S4-04 Agent Council Negotiation Scene**
- **S4-05 Matchup Intelligence Interactions**
- **S4-06 Revenue Observatory Dashboards**
- **S4-07 Role-based Overlays (optional)**

## Sprint 5 – Integration & Polish
- **S5-01 Content Load-In**: Replace placeholder data with validated narratives and metrics.
- **S5-02 Audio Integration**: Layer ambient tracks and cues with volume controls.
- **S5-03 Performance Optimization**: Audit animation impact, lazy-load media, compress assets.
- **S5-04 QA & Bug Bash**: Cross-browser/device testing, accessibility audit, compliance verification.
- **S5-05 Executive Rehearsal**: Dry-run with leadership, capture feedback, finalize release plan.

## Continuous Activities
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect stakeholder reactions after each milestone; adapt backlog accordingly.
- **Documentation**: Maintain changelog, data provenance, and compliance notes within repo.
- **Risk Tracking**: Monitor scope creep, asset delivery delays, and data sensitivity concerns.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Schedule kickoff review to confirm storyboard and data schema alignment.
2. Begin copy drafting for Leadership Prelude and Program Constellation scenes.
3. Assemble initial sample data for Auburn (men’s) and South Carolina (women’s) programs.
4. Start wireframe sketches capturing layout and navigation flow.
